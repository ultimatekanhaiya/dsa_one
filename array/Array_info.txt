An array is a collection of items of the same data type stored at contiguous memory locations.
This makes it easier to calculate the position of each element by simply adding an offset to a base value, i.e., 
the memory location of the first element of the array (generally denoted by the name of the array).

Insertion in Array

Insertion in array can be of 4 types:
    1.insertion in last when array is not full. O(1)
    2.insertion in last when array is full. O(n)
        we have to move all elements to new array
    3.insertion in middle with replacement. O(1)
    4.insertion in middle without replacement. O(n)
        we have to move all elements to 1 position right.
Properties:
    1.store homogeneous data.
    2.fixed in size.
    3.Arrays allow random access of elements.
    4.Arrays have better cache locality that can make a pretty big difference in performance.

When to use:
    1.when frequent operation is retrival operation and not insertion or deletion in middle.
